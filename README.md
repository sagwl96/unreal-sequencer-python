# unreal-sequencer-python
Python commands to key and edit sequences in Unreal Engine 5

Since these commands are being tested directly in the python console within unreal engine, 
they do not require an "import unreal" command at the start

These commands also work multiline, so multiple lines can be copied and pasted at once in the unreal python console
